# Easy Password

Super easy online passwords manager, built with [Laravel] ‚ù§Ô∏è.

## How does it works?

Easy! Just remember the password to log in to Easy Password. Then, you'll see all the passwords you stored.

You can also edit your stored passwords, add new ones, even generate a random password according to some parameters: length, type of characters, etc. ü§òü§ò

## And... What else?

It'd be fun to integrate this to the explorer (via extension) and just by right clicking a password input, you can select a password from Easy Password and paste it automatically! 

(But time to time...)
